It's always better late than never

Hi everyone, although I understand that I have been undergoing the irresistible brain-aging process for years, I still want to learn coding, dreaming of one day I could have developed something I liked. But my time that could be spent here, in at least the next two or three years, will be extremely limited. I will never forget here. Thank you.
